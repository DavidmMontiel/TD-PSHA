Catalogue structure:

ID: event identification number.
day: day in which the event was recorded.
month: month in which the event was recorded.
year: year in which the event was recoded.
hour: hour in which the event was recorded UTC.
minute: minute in which the event was recorded UTC.
second: second in which the event was recorded UTC.
longitude: longitude in degrees WGS84.
latitude: latitude in degrees WGS84.
depth: depth in kilometers.
mw: moment magnitude.
err_mw*: uncertainty in the mw.
mc: completeness magnitude.
**cluster_ID: identification number of the cluster to which the event belongs to.

*the events with error equal to zero had no error information in the IGN database nor needed conversion to Mw (thus having no error due to the homogeneization process).
**when applicable. In the case of Spain the declustering algorithm used was Gardner-Knopoff (GK74). Gardner, J. K. and Knopoff, L.: Is the sequence of earthquakes in Southern California, with aftershocks removed, Poissonian?, Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, 64, 1363â€“1367, https://doi.org/10.1785/bssa0640051363, 1974.
